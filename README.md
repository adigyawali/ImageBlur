# **Gaussian Image Blur**

This program blurs an image by applying Gaussian Blur using the normal distribution formula. 
Instead of  using pre-built libraries like OpenCV or PIL's built-in blur functions. Everything is done from scratch with a custom built kernel and a manual convulution function.

* "FirstBlur.jpg" is generated through a sigma value of 1
* "SecondBlur.jpg" is generated through a sigma value of 3
* Both are generated using a 7x7 Kernel
