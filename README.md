Gaussian Image Blur

This program blurs an image by applying Gaussian Blur using the normal distribution formula. Instead of using pre-built libraries like OpenCV or PIL's built-in blur functions, everything is done from scratch with a custom-built kernel and a manual convolution function.

Generated with σ = 1
<img src="images/FirstBlur.jpg" alt="First Blur" width="400"/>
Generated with σ = 3
<img src="images/SecondBlur.jpg" alt="Second Blur" width="400"/>

Both are generated using a 7×7 Kernel.
